**Overview**

- I used Node.js with Azure Functions for the backend. I am open to learning a new stack but due to time constraints ( I had to get this done this weekend ) I decided to stick with what I was familiar with.
- For the frontend I scaffolded the project using create-react-app
- I usually would avoid redux for such a small project however from reading the job description I believe you want to know my competancy level in this.
- I deployed the backend to an Azure Functions resource. The frontend I deployed as a SPA to Azure Blob Storage.

**If I had more time**

- Filtering on caregiver_ids to provide users with more granularity into who was delivering the medication. Assign caregiver_ids to randomly generated names to simulate what a real user would see. 
- Search box to allow user to find their recipient and filter on results accordingly (currently the recipient id is just hardcoded)
- Faciliate sorting on the columns.
- Integration testing. I've used Selenium in the past however it has it's drawbacks. Therefore I'm eager to read up more about Cypress.

If I think of anything else in the meantime I will update this page :)
