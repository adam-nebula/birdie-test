Birdie Task

- I used Node.js Azure Functions framework for the backend. I am open to learning new technologies but due to time constraints ( I had to get this done this weekend ) I decided to stick with what I was familiar with.

- For the frontend I scaffolded the project using create-react-app

- I deployed the backend to an Azure Functions resource. The frontend I deployed as a SPA to Azure Blob Storage.

See the deployed version here: https://birdietest.z33.web.core.windows.net/

If I think of anything else in the meantime I will update this page :)
